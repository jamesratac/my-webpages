                <p>
                    The main variables used in the model are headcount of full-time employees, labor and non-labor cost of employees, 
                    employee productive hours, employee output, and customer satisfaction survey results. 
                    These information were gathered from the Business Intelligence system, Finance, Operations Management, and HR Deparment
                    from different Nextcare Business Unit.

                <p>
                    The Productivity Model template has three main sections. These are: (1) consolidated worksheets; (2) data; and (3) input worksheets. 
                    <br><br>
                    The DATA worksheet serves as the source destination of raw data gathered from BI systems, HR, Finance and Ops Management.
                    The DATA worksheet is the only sheet required for any input/adjustment. 
                    All of the following data that is inputed in the DATA worksheet is sourced from Alteryx / direct source:
                    <ul>
                        <li>HR FTE Count</li>
                        <li>HR Average Salaries</li>
                        <li>Finance Cube</li>
                        <li>Operations Stakeholders</li>

                    <br>
                    For each business unit, there is a designated INPUT and CONSOLIDATED worksheet.              
                    <br><br>
                    The INPUT worksheet contains all the KPIs and data points required in the model. 
                    <br><br>
                    The INPUT worksheet requires NO manual modification. The input sheet reads directly from the DATA worksheet.
                    <br><br> 
                    The CONSOLIDATED worksheet provides the output Unit Cost. 
                    <br><br> 
                    The CONSOLIDATED worksheet requires NO manual modification. It reads directly from the DATA worksheet.
                    <br><br>
                    The template also includes a worksheet for the global input.

                        Nextcare Productivity Model involves all Nextcare Business Units (BU) such as UAE, Lebanon, KSA, Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco. 
                        Inputs from gulf entities are added to the UAE, thus creating a UAE+Gulf BU in the model.
